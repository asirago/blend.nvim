# lighter-go.nvim

A lightweight subset of [go.nvim](https://github.com/ray-x/go.nvim), built for learning how to write Neovim plugins and collecting only the Go development features I actually need.

# Purpose
lighter-go.nvim is a small learning project to understand how Neovim plugins work, especially how go.nvim integrates with the Go toolchain. Rather than cloning all of its functionality, this plugin focuses on the essentials and serves as a playground for experimentation.

# Installation

**Lazy.vim**

```
{
  "yourusername/lighter-go.nvim",
