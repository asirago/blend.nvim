# blend.nvim

A personal blend of essential Neovim functionality, built for learning how to write plugins and streamlining my own workflow.

---
## Purpose

**blend.nvim** serves as a personal learning lab and utility bundle. Rather than focusing on a single language or plugin, it collects small, useful pieces of functionality into one place. The goal is to keep my setup clean, unified, and serve as a practical sandbox for exploring Neovim plugin development.

{
  "asirago/blend.nvim",
    opts = {
        disable_default = false
    }
}
```
